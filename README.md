This little micro:bit demo lets you move a dot (ball) around the screen just by tilting the device.

# Tasks

- Make the movement less sensitive, consider adding a threshold before moving the dot
- Stop the dot from rolling off the screen!
- Make the dot move faster if you tilt the micro:bit more
- Add another dot to act as a 'goal', when the dot gets to the goal then move it elsewhere
- Add some internal score tracking so you get points every time you get to a goal  
- Show the score & end the game when the user presses either of the buttoms
